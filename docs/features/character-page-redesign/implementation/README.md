# Character Page and Landing Page Redesign

## Overview
This feature implements a redesign of the landing page and creates a new secured `/character` page for the Pip application. It aligns the visual identity with the "Cryptid Console" design system and enforces authentication using MSAL.js.

## Goals
1.  **Secure Access:** Ensure only authenticated users can access the character dashboard.
2.  **Visual Consistency:** Adopt the "Cryptid Console" aesthetic (Tailwind, Fonts, Colors).
3.  **Improved UX:** Clear login flow and separation of public (landing) vs. private (character) content.
